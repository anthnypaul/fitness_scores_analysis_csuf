    "Physical Fitness plays a large role in the overall health and well being of college students. These factors influencing fitness can help in designing targeted interventions to promote healthier lifestyles. Researchers at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), in collaboration with various departments, have collected data on health and fitness-related variables for a long-term study. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to approximate the **Total Fitness Factor Score (FFTotal)** using other variables in the dataset. In this project, we will be using **explatory data analysis**, **linear regression modeling**, and **performance evaluation** to better understand the data. "

    "- **Resting HR**: Resting heart rate (in bpm), self-reported or measured.\n",
    "- **Systolic BP (SBP)** and **Diastolic BP (DBP)**: Brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressure (in mmHg), measured in a seated position.\n",
    "- **Ambient Temperature (TA)**: Temperature of the testing environment in degrees Celsius.\n",
    "- **Barometric Pressure (PB)**: Measured barometric pressure (in mmHg).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk Factors\n",
    "- **RF 2**: Gender-based risk factor (Female = 1, Male = 5).\n",
    "- **RF 3**: Stress score based on 11 questions (range: 11–55).\n",
    "- **RF 4**: Family history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) categorized into severity levels.\n",
    "- **RF 5**: Smoking history, self-reported (categories based on number of cigarettes/day).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome Variable\n",
    "- **Total Fitness Factor Score (FFTotal)**: The primary outcome variable, representing an overall fitness metric calculated using a proprietary formula.\n"
